## Tools

A number of tools and scripts have been developed to assist the EDX team in data gathering and visualization.

### [Apps Script](Tools/apps-script/README.md)

### [Capture Website](Tools/capture-website/README.md)

### [Radial Tidy Tree/ Dendrogram](Tools/radial-tidy-tree/README.md)

### [Statuscard](Tools/statuscard/README.md)

Content has since moved to [Touchpoints](https://github.com/gsa/touchpoints). This version can be run locally and demonstrates the red light/ green light functionality.
