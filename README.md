#### What is Digital Experience?

Digital experience describes all the interactions people have with an organization via digital channels. GSAâ€™s Enterprise Digital Experience (EDX) Team, part of the Office of Customer Experience (OCE), leads and coordinates efforts to improve digital experience across GSA, working closely with GSAâ€™s Digital Council (Council) and Digital Experience Executive Board (Board).

* Documenting a Digital Lifecycle Program to improve creation, management, and sunsetting of GSA websites and * digital properties
* Coordinating [enterprise web modernization efforts](https://github.com/GSA/wg-web-modernization) related to 21st Century IDEA
* Collaborating with the Office of Strategic Communication and GSA IT to lead the Digital Council, support the Executive Board, and improve knowledge sharing across GSA on initiatives to improve digital experience.
